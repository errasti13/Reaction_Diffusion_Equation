# Adimensional Chemical Reaction-Diffusion Equation Solver

This MATLAB project solves the adimensional chemical reaction-diffusion equation for varying values of the Peclet number. The equation describes the concentration profile of a chemical species undergoing reaction and diffusion in a one-dimensional domain. The script uses the `ode45` solver to integrate the equation and produces plots of the concentration and normalized reaction rate.

## Description

The purpose of this MATLAB project is to solve the adimensional chemical reaction-diffusion equation and visualize the results through plots. The key features of the project include:

- Solving the equation for varying values of the Peclet number.
- Plotting the concentration profile and the normalized reaction rate.
- Visualizing the relationship between concentration, temperature adimensional, and reaction rate.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB: This project requires MATLAB installed on your machine.
- Symbolic Math Toolbox: The use of symbolic variables and equations requires the Symbolic Math Toolbox.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `main.m` script.

## Results

After running the script, you will obtain the following results:

- Plots of the concentration profile and the normalized reaction rate as functions of the adimensional concentration.
- A plot showing the concentration profile and the temperature adimensional as functions of a normalized coordinate.
